            When you plog, you pick up trash as you go about your daily life... jogging, hiking, or simply walking down the street. Ploggers help keep our neighborhoods, parks, and oceans clean.
          </Text>
          <Text style={$S.body}>
            Plogalong helps you track your plogging history and see who else is plogging nearby. Stay motivated by earning badges and plogging minutes, or sharing your plogs on social media.
          </Text>
          <Text style={$S.body}>
            Plogalong was designed by <A href="https://slipperstudios.com">Slipper Studios</A>, and was built as an open source civic project at <A href="https://www.codeforboston.org">Code for Boston</A>.
